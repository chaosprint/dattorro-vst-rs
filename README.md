# What is this?

This repository contains the source code to build a Dattorro's plate reverb effect VST plugin that can be used in different DAWs such as Ableton Live, Bitwig, etc.

Dattorro's plate reverb is one of the most popular audio effects with its structure [open to the public](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf). Yet it would be quite challenging to build it from ground up without a good framework. Thus, this repo is also an example of using `glicol_synth` with other Rust audio libraries.

Here's a video demo:

# Some resources

The GUI frontend is developed with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

The audio engine is written with [glicol_synth](https://github.com/chaosprint/glicol).

The template is from:

https://github.com/DGriffin91/egui_baseview_test_vst2

Also check the projects behind the template if you are interested:

https://github.com/RustAudio/vst-rs

Thanks for all the contributors in the relevant projects. Without them, developing VST in Rust would not be so straightforward.

# Usage

You can download it directly for your music making, or you can build from the source code with some requirement.

> Currently, this plugin has only been tested on Apple computers (both M1 or Inter models).

Update:

> It also works on Windows, although the GUI does not have hi-res.

## Download

See the latest release page:

## Build from source code

If you are interested in Rust audio, congradulations. It is really a joy to code with Rust in almost all aspects.

### Step 1

First, you need to have rust compiler on your computer.

Make sure you can run `cargo -V` and `rustup -V` from your terminal.

### Step 2

Run the following commands from your Mac's Terminal:

- `git clone https://github.com/chaosprint/dattorro-vst-rs.git`
- `cd dattorro-vst-rs`
- `sudo zsh scripts/build.sh`

On Windows:

- Run `cargo build --release` on Terminal
- Copy `target/release/dattorro_vst_rs.dll` to your VST plugin folder

If everything goes well, then you are ready to go.

### Step 3

Open your DAW.

> If you use an M1 mac, make sure you run the DAW with Rosetta.

Then try to find the VST plugin. For Ableton Live, here's a guide:

https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209068929-Using-AU-and-VST-plug-ins-on-Mac

> If there's some security warning such as `cannot open`, go to your Mac's `System Preferences`, `Security & Privacy`, and then click `Open anyway`.

Then, you can just use the plugin!
